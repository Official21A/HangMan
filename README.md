# HangMan
The old hangman game with python "Qt" user interface.

# Introduction
Welcome to the old Hangman game, where you need to guess a word by letters or itself.
The game itself is easy and basically you can write it into a consol page, but
in this project I used the python Qt which is a user interface, so the game bacomes more
like a computer game.

Designed very easily that you can clone the project and read the codes without any helps.
I tried to use all of a GUI components that we need in a program in this codes.

If you want to know all the components and get a complete knowledge about pyQt check these links:

```

# Tools
All tools we need for this project is the pyQt library with sys library which is installed, but pyQt
is not installed on your systems, so you have to install it.

Just follow these steps:

1.
```
python3 -m venv venv 
```
2.
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
3.
```
pip install PyQt5==5.9.2
```
